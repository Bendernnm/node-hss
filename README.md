## Install

## Description

   Simple server static. Wrote on native Node.js!
   
   It would be good a point for you if you need a fast setup server to provide access to the public files. I recommend using this package only for the development process, no for production.

   Why this library, no something else? Cause only here you can found powerful features that help you in development way (at least create static server) and we proud of the stability and performance of our product.

## Features

## Simple use

   If you haven't enough time for reading a lot of instructions or chief annoying you with phrases like this one: - 'Just do it! And faster please!' Just do this simple steps:

1. Install

    ```jsx
    npm install package-name
    ```

2. Create *server.js* file and put this code here:

    ```jsx
    const { StaticServer } = require('package-name');

    StaticServer.setup().startServer();
    ```

3. Then create public folder in the same level to the server.js file. And put several files for sharing. Like in this amazing picture:
